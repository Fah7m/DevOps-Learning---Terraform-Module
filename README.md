Important things to note:
---
When deploying a resource like an EC2 instance to AWS, each region will have a different AMI so if you copy an AMI from eu-west-2 but are trying to deploy in eu-west-1. Then terraform will return an error as that image doesn't exist in that region.

**tfvar and Var.tf files**

A variables.tf file is where you declare your variables and can have them answered such as setting a default in the file or other values like desctiption etc. 

The ,tfvar file is where you can assign values to those variables instead of setting defaults within the variables.tf file as that can be very long or setting it in the command line if no default is set. Using this makes things much more organized and repeatable and safe.

If you also have a value in a *.tfvars file, the tfvars value will override the default.

If you pass something with -var on the CLI, that will override both.
A variables.tf file is used to declare variables and the tfvar file can be used to assign values to those declared variables instead of having to
